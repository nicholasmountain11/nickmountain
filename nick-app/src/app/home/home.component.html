            The purpose of this website is to provide a way for me to experiment with 
            Angular and to showcase some things that I have made and learned.

            I am in the process of building a CustomGPT chatbot that will be trained to talk like me. 
            My hope is that I can integrate it into this website so that you can have a conversation with it.
            As of 12/21/23 (the day I am writing this), OpenAI has not built an API for CustomGPT's, but presumably
            they will in the future.

            I am also thinking of moving my <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/darwin_nunswift/" target="_blank">Darwin Nunez/Taylor Swift Instagram bot</a>
            to this website as an interactive page.
