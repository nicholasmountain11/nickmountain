# Personal Website and Wii Golf Score Tracker

Portfolio [website](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/) to showcase me and some of the projects I have worked on. One such project can be found at the [Wii Golf tab](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/#/wii-golf) of this website.

This website is built with AngularJS.

## Portfolio Website

You can find information about me on the Home, About Me, Projects, and Work Experience pages. On the [Projects](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/#/projects) page, you will find a list of some of my projects that can be filtered by which technologies were used.

## [Wii Golf Score Tracker](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/#/wii-golf)

A place for my friends and I (and anyone who wants to) to keep track of our Wii Golf scores. You can add yourself as a player, keep track of your rounds, and look at the top 10 best rounds ever recorded.

This project uses my [Wii Golf API](https://github.com/nicholasmountain11/wii-golf-api), built with Java Spring Boot, to interact with a MySQL database.
