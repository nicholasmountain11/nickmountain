# Personal Website and Wii Golf Score Tracker

Portfolio [website](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/) to showcase me and some of the projects I have worked on. One such project is the Wii Golf Score Tracker, which is built locally as an extension to this website, its description is below.

This website is built with AngularJS.

## Portfolio Website

You can find information about me on the Home, About Me, Projects, and Work Experience pages. On the [Projects](https://nicholasmountain11.github.io/nickmountain/#/projects) page, you will find a list of some of my projects that can be filtered by which technologies were used.

## Wii Golf Score Tracker

A place for my friends and I (and anyone who wants to) to keep track of our Wii Golf scores. You can add yourself as a player, keep track of your rounds, and look at the top 10 best rounds ever recorded.

This project uses my [Wii Golf API](https://github.com/nicholasmountain11/wii-golf-api), built with Java Spring Boot, to interact with a MySQL database.
